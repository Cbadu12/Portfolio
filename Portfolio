    <h1>MY PORTFOLIO</h1>
        <p>I am Comfort Boamah Adu, a freshman Biomedical Engineering major in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.</p>
    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p> I have always been drawn to the intersection of Technology, Biology and Medicine. Even as a child, I loved figuring out how things worked. I became fascinated by something as small as a glucose monitor or an insulin pump could empower someone to live a fuller, healthier life.</p>
    <p> Out of this curiosity, I pursued General Science in High School and I developed strong passion for the creation of technologies that make tangible differences in the lives of people.</p>
    <p> I chose Biomedical Engineering because it perfectly merges my love for problem-solving with my desire to impact healthcare. The field's interdisciplinary nature with courses in areas like Biology, Medicine and Engineering excites me.</p>
    <p> I want to pioneer devices that transform lives.</p>
